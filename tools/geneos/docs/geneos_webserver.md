# `geneos` Web Dashboard Servers

A `webserver` is an instance of a Web Dashboard.

It is not currently possible to manage TLS certificates and keys for
`webserver` instances.

A new `webserver` instance is created using local package configuration
files, therefore the same package version must be installed locally as
on any remote host.
