# `geneos tls init`

Initialise the TLS environment

```text
geneos tls init
```

Initialise the TLS environment by creating a self-signed root
certificate to act as a CA and a signing certificate signed by the root.
Any instances will have certificates created for them but configurations
will not be rebuilt.
