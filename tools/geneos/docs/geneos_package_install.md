# `geneos package install`

The `install` command will, with no other options, download and unarchive the latest releases of each currently installed Geneos component from the official ITRS download servers.

If given directories or file paths on the command line then the install command will only use these as the sources for installation and will not try to download any release. Any values that are not directory paths have symlinks resolved before the underlying filename is checked for component type and version (see `--override` below). This allows, for example, a fixed symlink to the latest version of a local release.

If a component TYPE is given on the command line then installation is limited to that component type, otherwise all components types matching existing components are installed.

To install all component types use the `--all`/`-A` flag.

ðŸ’¡ Downloads require an ITRS client login and credentials must be provided.

Download credentials can be from those stored locally by the `geneos login` command or those supplied on the command line with the --`username`|`-u` option, which will prompt for a password. In previous versions of cordial you may have also stored credentials in the `geneos` program's own configuration, which will still be used if available.

The deprecated `--pwfile`/`-P` option can be used to refer to a local file containing the password.

If you have already downloaded the release archives then you can use the `--local`/`-L` option to use local files. If you do not supply a file name or directory on the command line then the command will look in the `packages/downloads` directory under the Geneos installation directory.

Downloads are normally saved in the above directory but this can be disabled with the `--nosave`/`-n` option. This is the default if you install locally from a specific directory or file too.

With the `--update`/`-U` option the command will also update the active versions for base specified by `--base`/`-b` (default of `active_prod`) by stopping any instances that use that base name and starting them again after updating the links. Because links are potentially shared by many instances the install may succeed but the update fail if any instances are protected. To also update protected instances use the `--force`/`-F` flag. Note that all matching instances will be stopped, even those that may not be updated, as it is not wholly predictable what version may be installed and the instances must be stopped beforehand.

The `--force`/`-F` flags implies `--update`.

By default the latest version found will be the one installed, either from the download site or locally. To install a specific version from the use the `--version`/`-V` option with a version in the form `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` where omitting `PATCH` will get the latest patch release for `MAJOR.MINOR` and omitting `MINOR.PATCH` will get the latest version in the `MAJOR` set. Versions cannot be selected for remote `el8` archives because of a restriction in indexing releases. Specifying a version with either a local only or with a directory name on the command line will apply the same rules to all matching local files. This flag is ignored if specific archive files are given on the command line.

If you have downloaded a release but have changed the file name from the original then you must use the `--override`/`-O` option to inform the `install` command which component type and release version the archive contains, e.g. `-T gateway:5.12.1`. The command will not validate your option and will simply unarchive the file, if it can, in the directory that would be created for that component and version. If this option is used with either more than on file or a directory on the command line then that is an error.

For internal ITRS users there are the `--nexus`/`-N` and `--snapshot`/`-S` options to download archives from the internal nexus server. The `--snapshot`/`-S` option implies `--nexus`/`-N`. You may need to supply different credentials for these downloads.

Installations can be limited to a specific host with the global `--host`/`-H` option otherwise the installation is done to all configured hosts.

Finally, if you just want to download releases and not install them - so you can put them on a shred drive for example - then you can use the `--download`/`-D` option. This will download the selected releases to the current directory, or if you give a directory on the command line then to that directory. Note that this option makes no sense with a number of other command line options and will error if those are given, e.g. `--local/-L` and so on.

To use a proxy, when direct connectivity from your server may not be available, set the appropriate environment variables as detailed in the Go documentation: <https://pkg.go.dev/net/http#ProxyFromEnvironment>. The values of these variables are the same as for the industry-standard examples you will find on the web.
