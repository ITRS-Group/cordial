# `geneos` Self-Announcing Netprobe Comopnents

A Self-Announcing Netprobe (SAN) used the standard Netprobe installation
package but annnounces itself to the Gateway and carries much of it's
own configuration in a local setup XML file. Multiple SANs can connect
to a Gateway as long as each has it's own, unique name.
