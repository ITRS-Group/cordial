# `geneos init template`

Initialise or overwrite templates

```text
geneos init template [flags]
```

The `geneos` commands contains a number of default template files that
are normally written out during initialization of a new installation. In
the case of adopting a legacy installation or upgrading the program it
might be desirable to extract these template files.

This command will overwrite any files with the same name but will not
delete other template files that may already exist.

Use this command if you get missing template errors using the `add`
command.
