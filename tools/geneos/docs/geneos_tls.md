# `geneos tls`

The `tls` sub-system allows you to manage certificates for [Geneos Secure Communications](https://docs.itrsgroup.com/docs/geneos/current/SSL/ssl_ug.html).

You can import and manage your own certificates or create your own certificates with your own certificate authority (also known, incorrectly, as "self-signed" certificates).

Commands allow for initialisation, create and renewal of certificates as well as listing details and copying a certificate chain to all other hosts.

Each instance may use the following parameters:

* `certificate` - the path to a certificate file in PEM format
* `privatekey` - the path to a private key file for the certificate above
* `certchain` - the path to a file containing one or more PEM formatted certificates that form a trust chains
* `use-chain` - a boolean parameter that controls the use of the chain file above

Those components which may offer TLS protected services on a listening port will do so if the `certificate` and `privatekey` parameters are defined and point to valid files.

Those components that act as clients and connect to servers, Geneos or otherwise, will validate the connection based on the `certchain` and `use-chain` settings. If these are not set or the file does not exist then the connection is still established using TLS but is not verified to be using a trusted certificate.
