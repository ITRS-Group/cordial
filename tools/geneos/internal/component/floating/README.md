A Floating Netprobe used the same installation package as the normal Netprobe but uses a confirmation file to identify remote Gateway(s) to connect to. The primary differences between a Floating Netprobe and a SAN (Self-Announcing Netprobe) is that all the configuration for a Floating Netprobe is kept in the Gateway and that a Floating Netprobe has a one-to-one correspondence with it's set-up.
