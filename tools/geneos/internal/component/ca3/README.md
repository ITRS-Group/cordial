# `geneos` Collection Agents

A `ca3` instance is an unmanaged Collection Agent. The instances uses
the standard Netprobe installation package and needs Java 11 installed.

A new `ca3` instance is created using local package configuration files,
therefore the same package version must be installed locally as on any
remote host.
