A `fileagent` is a File Agent used with Fix Analyser2.

The Fileagent is a small agent used to relay files from one system to a Geneos Netprobe. Normally deployed with Fix Analyser 2, this allows high volume logs to be sent off-host for further processing with minimal impact on the main system which tend to be sensitive to load.
