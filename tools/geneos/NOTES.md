# Restructuring notes

Components are labels
Remotes are locations

Instances are:

* names
* structs
* config files
  * including XML configs
* go interfaces

Remotes are

* transports
* containers
* go interfaces

Concurrency support

* long running daemon
* web/rest interface
* parallel tasks over instances

Function and method naming

* use proper go idioms
* does anything fit existing models, e.g. http package
