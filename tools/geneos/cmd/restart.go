Restart the matching instances.

By default this is identical to running |geneos stop| followed by
|geneos start|.

If the |--all|/|-a| option is given then all matching instances are
started regardless of whether they were stopped by the command.

Protected instances will not be restarted unless the |--force|/|-F|
option is given.

Normal behaviour is to send, on Linux, a SIGTERM to the process and
wait for a short period before trying again until the process is no
longer running. If this fails to stop the process a SIGKILL is sent
to terminate the process without further action. If the |--kill|/|-K|
option is used then the terminate signal is sent immediately without
waiting. Beware that this can leave instance files corrupted or in an
indeterminate state.

If the |--log|/|-l| option is given then the logs of all instances
that are started are followed until interrupted by the user.
