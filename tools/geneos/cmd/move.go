Move (or rename) instances. As any existing legacy .rc
file is never changed, this will migrate the instance from .rc to
JSON. The instance is stopped and restarted after the instance is
moved. It is an error to try to move an instance to one that already
exists with the same name.

If the component support rebuilding a templated configuration then
this is run after the move but before the restart. This allows SANs
to be updated as expected.

Moving across hosts is fully supported.
