Clean-up instance directories by removing old log & config file backups
from the working directory of the targetted instances, without affecting
the running instances.

If run with the |-F| (or |--full|) option, |geneos clean| will stop the 
targetted instances, remove all non-essential files from the working 
directory of the targetted instances and restart the targetted instances.

**Note**: Files removed by |geneos clean| are defined in the geneos main 
configuration file |geneos.json| as |[TYPE]CleanList|.
Files removed by |geneos clean -F| or |geneos clean --full| are defined
in the geneos main configuration file |geneos.json| as |[TYPE]PurgeList|.
Both these lists are formatted as a PathListSeparator (typically a colon) 
separated list of file globs.
