Clean the working directories for all matching instances.

The default behavior is to leave the instance running and only inactive files
are removed.

With the |--full|/|-F| option, the command will stop the
instance, remove all non-essential files from the working
directory of the instance and restart the instance.

**Note**: Files removed by |geneos clean| are defined in the geneos main
configuration file |geneos.json| as |[TYPE]CleanList|. Files removed by
|geneos clean -F| or |geneos clean --full| are defined in the geneos main
configuration file |geneos.json| as |[TYPE]PurgeList|. Both these lists are
formatted as a PathListSeparator (typically a colon) separated list of file
globs.
