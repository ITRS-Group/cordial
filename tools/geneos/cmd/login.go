Prompt for and stored credentials for later use by commands.

Typical use is for downloading release archives from the official ITRS web
site.

If not given |URLPATTERN| defaults to |itrsgroup.com|. When credentials are
used, the destination is checked against all stored credentials and the
longest match is selected.

If no |-u USERNAME| is given then the user is prompted for a username.

If no |-p PASSWORD| is given then the user is prompted for the password,
which is not echoed, twice and it is only accepted if both instances match.

The credentials are encrypted with the keyfile specified with |-k KEYFILE|
and if not given then the user's default keyfile is used - and created if it
does not exist. See |geneos aes new| for details.

The credentials cannot be used without the keyfile and each set of
credentials can use a separate keyfile.
