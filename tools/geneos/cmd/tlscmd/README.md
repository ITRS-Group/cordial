Manage certificates for [Geneos Secure Communications](https://docs.itrsgroup.com/docs/geneos/current/SSL/ssl_ug.html).

You can import and manage your own certificates or create your own certificates with your own certificate authority (also known, incorrectly, as "self-signed" certificates).

Commands allow for initialisation, create and renewal of certificates as well as listing details and copying a certificate chain to all other hosts.
