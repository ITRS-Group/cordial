The `tls export` command gathers and outputs the local Geneos signing certificate and private key and the root CA certificate (but not the private key) as a single PEM file.

By default the PEM formatted set of certificates and key is to the console but you can write them to a file using the `--output FILE`/`-o FILE` option. The file is created with 0600 permissions.

To not include the root CA certificate, which may be valid in some limited cases, use the `--no-root`/`-N` option.

The resulting PEM data can be imported into another Geneos instance through one of the `geneos deploy --import-cert`, `geneos init --import-cert` or `geneos tls import --signer` commands.
