List certificates and their details. The root and signing certs are only shown if the `--all`/`-a` flag is given. A list with more details can be seen with the `--long`/`-l` flag, otherwise options are the same as for the main ls command.

Certificates for each instance are validated and the "Valid" column or field contains the boolean result. An instance certificate is valid if **all** the following are true:

* The file path from the instance "`certificate`" parameter is readable, is in PEM format and can be parsed as an x509 certificate
* The file path from the instance "`privatekey`" parameter is readable, is in PEM format and matches the certificate above
* The certificate is inside it's validity period
* The certificate can be verified against the trust chain from one of:
    * the file path from the instance "`certchain`" parameter
    * the installation global "`tls/geneos-chain.pem`" file
    * the system certificate pool
* The certificate also conforms to other checks done by <https://pkg.go.dev/crypto/x509#Certificate.Verify>

The Common Name (`CN`) and the Subject Alternative Names (`SAN`) values in the certificate are not otherwise checked as Geneos does not use these.
