Copy instances.

In case the source instance is running, it is not sopped.
All configurations (|<TYPE>.json| file) from the source instance will be
replicated in the destination instance with:
- parameter |home| updated to the home directory of the destimation instance,
- parameter |name| updated to the name of the destimation instance,
- parameter |port| updated to an automatically assigned port number.
  This may be changed using |geneos set|.
Non essential files such as logs, cache, etc. will not be replicated.

Moving across hosts is supported.
