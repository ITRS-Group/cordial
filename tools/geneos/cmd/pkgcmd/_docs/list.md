List the packages for the matching TYPE or all component types if no
TYPE is given. The `-H` flags restricts the check to a specific
remote host.

All timestamps are displayed in UTC to avoid filesystem confusion
between local summer/winter times in some locales.

Versions are listed in descending order for each component type, i.e.
`latest` is always the first entry for each component.
