Uninstall selected Geneos releases. By default all releases that are
not used by any instance, including disabled instances, are removed
with the exception of the "latest" release for each component type.

If |TYPE| is given then only releases for that component are
uninstalled. Similarly if |--version VERSION| is given then only that
version is removed unless it is in use by an instance (including
disabled instances). Version wildcards are not yet supported.

To remove releases that are in use by instances you must give the
|--force| flag and this will first shutdown any running instance
using that release and update base links and versions to "latest".

Any release that is referenced by a symlink (e.g. |active_prod|) will
have the symlink updated as for instances above. This includes the
need to pass |--force| if there are running instances, but unlike
instances that reference releases directly |--force| is not required
if there is no running process using the symlinked release.

Additionally if the |-all| flag is passed then all releases for
matching components are removed and all running instances stopped and
disabled. This can be used to force a "clean install" of a component
or before removal of a Geneos installation on a specific host.

If no other release is available then the instance will be disabled.
Instances that were not already running are not started.

If a host is not selected with the |--host HOST| flags then the
uninstall applies to all configured hosts. 

Use |geneos update ls| to see what is installed.
