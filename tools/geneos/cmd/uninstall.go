Uninstall selected Geneos releases. By default all releases that are
not used by an instance, including disabled instances, are removed
with the exception of the "latest" release for each component type.

If |TYPE| is given then only releases for that component are
uninstalled. Similarly if |--version VERSION| is given then only that
version is installed unless it is in use by an instance (including
disabled instances). Version wildcards are not yet supported.

To remote releases that are in use by instances you must give the
|--force| flag and this will first shutdown any running instance
using that releases, and the it will first try to rollback to the
previous release and restart any stopped instances, or if an earlier
release is not installed then it will roll-forward to the next
available release (and restart). Finally, if no other release is
available then the instance will be disabled. Instances that were not
already running are not started.

Any release that is referenced by a symlink (e.g. |active_prod|) will
have the symlink updated as for instances above. This includes the
need to pass |--force| if there are running instances, but unlike
instances that reference releases directly |--force| is not required
if there is no running process using the symlinked release.

If a host is not selected with the |--host HOST| flags then the
uninstall applies to all configured hosts. 

Use |geneos update ls| to see what is installed.
