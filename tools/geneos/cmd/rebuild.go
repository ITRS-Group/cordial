	Long: strings.ReplaceAll(`
All matching instances whose TYPE supported templates for
configuration file will have them rebuilt depending on the
|config.rebuild| setting for each instance.

The values for the |config.rebuild| option are: |never|, |initial|
and |always|. The default value depends on the TYPE; For Gateways it
is |initial| and for SANs and Floating Netprobes it is |always|.

You can force a rebuild for an instance that has the |config.rebuild|
set to |initial| by using the |--force|/|-F| option. Instances with a
|never| setting are never rebuilt.

The change this use something like |geneos set gateway
config.rebuild=always|

Instances will not normally update their settings when the
configuration file changes, although there are options for both
Gateways and Netprobes to do this, so you can trigger a configuration
reload with the |--reload|/|-r| option. This will send the
appropriate signal to matching instances regardless of the underlying
configuration being updated or not.

The templates use for each TYPE are stored in a |templates/|
directory under each TYPE. If you do not have templates because you
are adopting an existing installation or you have upgraded the
|geneos| program and want updated templates then run |geneos init
template| to overwrite existing file with the built-in ones.
