Import each |SOURCE| to instance directories. With the
|--common|/|-c| option the imports are to a TYPE component
sub-directory |TYPE_| suffixed with the value to the |--common|/|-c|
option. See examples below.

The |SOURCE| can be the path to a local file, a URL or '-' for STDIN.
|SOURCE| may not be a directory.

If the |SOURCE| is a file in the current directory then it must be
prefixed with |"./"| to avoid being seen as an instance NAME to
search for. Any file path with a directory separator already present
does not need this precaution. The program will read from STDIN if
the |SOURCE| '-' is given but this can only be used once and a
destination DEST must be defined.

If |DEST| is given with a |SOURCE| then it must either be a plain file
name or a descending relative path. An absolute or ascending path is
an error.

Without an explicit |DEST| for the destination file only the base name
of the |SOURCE| is used. If |SOURCE| is a URL then the file name for
the resource from the remote web server is preferred over the last
part of the URL.

If the |--common|/|-c| option is used then a TYPE must also be
specified. Each component of TYPE has a base directory. That
directory may contain, in addition to instances of that TYPE, a
number of other directories that can be used for shared resources.
These may be scripts, include files and so on. Using a TYPE |gateway|
as an example and using a |--common config| option the destination
for |SOURCE| would be |gateway/gateway_config|

Future release may add support for directories and.or unarchiving of
|tar.gz|/|zip| and other file archives.
