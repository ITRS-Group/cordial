The `geneos host unset` command allows you to remove parameters from host configurations. This can be used to remove items like encrypted passwords as well as private key file paths. Like the main `geneos unset` command parameters have to be named using the `--key/-k` command line flag and to remove private key files from the list use `--privatekey/-i PATH`. At this time the paths to private key files must be given exactly as in the configuration and you cannot use wildcards.
