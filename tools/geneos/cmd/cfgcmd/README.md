# `geneos config` Subsystem Commands

The commands in the `config` subsystem allow you to control the
environment of the `geneos` program itself. Please see the
descriptions of the commands below for more information.

If you run this command directly then you will either be shown the
output of `geneos config show` or `geneos config set [ARGS]` if you
supply any further arguments that contain an "=".
