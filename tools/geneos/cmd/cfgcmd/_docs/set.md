Set configuration parameters for the `geneos` program.

Each value is in the form of `KEY=VALUE` where key is the configuration
item and value an arbitrary string value. Where a `KEY` is in a
hierarchy use a dot (`.`) as the delimiter.

While you can set arbitrary keys only some have any meaning. The most
important one is `geneos`, the path to the root directory of the Geneos
installation managed by the program. If you change or remove this value
you may break the functionality of the program, so please be careful.

For an explanation of the various configuration parameters see the main
documentation.
