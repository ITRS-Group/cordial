	Short: "Import key files for component TYPE",
	Long: strings.ReplaceAll(`
Import keyfiles to the TYPE |keyfiles| directory in each matching
component TYPE shared directory.

A key file must be provided with the |--keyfile|/|-k| option. The
option value can be a path or a URL or a '-' to read from STDIN. A
prefix of |~/| to the path interprets the rest relative to the home
directory.

The key file is copied from the supplied source to a file with the
base-name of its 8-hexadecimal digit checksum to distinguish it from
other key files. In all examples the CRC is shown as |DEADBEEF| in
honour of many generations of previous UNIX documentation. There is a
very small chance of a checksum clash.

The shared directory for each component is one level above instance
directories and has a |_shared| suffix. The convention is to use this
path for Geneos instances to share common configurations and
resources. e.g. for a Gateway the path would be
|.../gateway/gateway_shared/keyfiles| where instance directories
would be |.../gateway/gateways/NAME|

If a TYPE is given then the key is only imported for that component,
otherwise the key file is imported to all components that are known to
support key files. Currently only Gateways and Netprobes (including
SANs) are supported.

Key files are imported to all configured hosts unless |--host|/|-H| is
used to limit to a specific host.

Instance names can be given to indirectly identify the component
type.
