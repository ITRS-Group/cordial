The `aes` sub-system allows you to manage AES256 keyfiles and perform encryption and decryption.

The `aes` commands provide tools to manage Geneos AES256 key files as documented in the [Secure Passwords](https://docs.itrsgroup.com/docs/geneos/current/Gateway_Reference_Guide/gateway_secure_passwords.htm) section of the manuals.

In addition to the functionality built-in to Geneos as described in the Gateway documentation these encoded password can also be included in configuration files so that plain text passwords and other credentials are not visible to users.
