Start the matching instances.

The start-up command and environment can be seen using the `geneos
command` command.

Any matching instances that are marked as `disabled` are not started.

With the `--log`/`-l` option the command will follow the logs of all
instances started, including the STDERR logs as these are good sources
of start-up issues.
