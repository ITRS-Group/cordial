Enable matching instances and, if the `--start`/`-S` options is set then start the instance. Only those instances that were disabled are started when the `--start`/`-S` flag is used.

If called with no arguments `delete` will take no action. If you do want to match all instances then you must use the explicit instance wildcard `all`.
