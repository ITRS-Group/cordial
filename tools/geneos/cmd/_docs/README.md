# Raw Command Documentation

The files in this directory are **not** intended for end-users but are
used to embed help text in the commands.

The end-user documentation is generated and placed in the
[docs](/tools/geneos/docs) directory.

These files are here to make the editing of the markdown easier instead
of in string constants in the code.
