# dv2email - Dataview To HTML

`dv2email` is a lightweight program to capture and transform Geneos Dataviews to HTML suitable for inclusion in email and other messaging systems.

## Usage

* Configure Your Gateways

  You have to enable the REST Command API in your Gateways. You should have a user account on the Gateways that support password authentication and is limited to `data` permissions, i.e. a read-only account. How to do this can be found in the following documentation:

  * [REST Service ðŸ”—](https://docs.itrsgroup.com/docs/geneos/current/Gateway_Reference_Guide/geneos_commands_tr.html#REST_Service)
  * [Authentication ðŸ”—](https://docs.itrsgroup.com/docs/geneos/6.3.0/Gateway_Reference_Guide/geneos_authentication_tr.html)

* Install `dv2email` and `geneos` (optional) somewhere in your execution path (or use the full path to where you install them).

  Next create your `dv2email` YAML configuration files. You need at least one configuration file for the program to locate your Gateway and SMTP server:

  * `${HOME}/.config/geneos/dv2email.yaml` - where `${HOME}` is the home directory of the user running the Gateway(s) - which may not be your own user (optional)

    This configuration file should contain common configuration that applies across all Gateways and also shared email server configurations and credentials.

  * `dv2email.yaml` in the working directory (e.g. `geneos home gateway MyGateway`) of each Gateway (optional)

    This configuration file (see details below) should contain all customisations for the Gateway and the format of the emails you want to send. The contents of this file are merged with the file above, if it exists. Settings in this file take precedence.

  If either file contains credentials, even when AES256 encrypted, they should be only readable by the Gateway user; that is `chmod 0400 dv2email.yaml`.

* Store credentials (optional)

  Next, optionally store any credentials in the Gateway user's `geneos` managed `credentials.yaml` file using `geneos login`. This is not necessary if you embed credentials in the dv2email.yaml files. The two kinds of credential you can store are for the Gateway REST Command API and for the SMTP server:

  * `geneos login gateway:GATEWAYNAME -u READONLYUSER` or `geneos login gateway -u READONLYUSER`

    This will store credentials either for the gateway `GATEWAYNAME` or for all gateways and for the user `READONLYUSER`. You will be prompted to enter the password for the user twice.

  * `geneos login smtp.example.com -u USERNAME`

    This will store credentials for your SMTP server for user `USERNAME`. You will br prompted for the password twice.

  If you do not store your credentials this way then you must provide them directly in the `dv2email.yaml` configuration file.

* Test

  You should now be able to test your configuration. You can do this by simulating a minimal alert on the command line:

  ```bash
  cd $(geneos home MyGateway)
  _VARIABLEPATH='//dataview[(@name="SOMEDATAVIEWNAME")]' dv2email
  ```

  Replace `SOMEDATAVIEWNAME` above with the name of a Dataview on your Gateway that is likely to match exactly one Dataview. If it matches more than one Dataview then in the test template all matching Dataviews will be included in the email.

  If the program returns with no output then it has succeeded in sending an email, otherwise review the errors and resolve them as needed. Most issues will be related to authentication, either to the Gateways or to the email server.

* Update Templates

  Update your templates to suite you requirements. The built-in template produces output which says clearly that it is for testing and should be edited for local requirements. The templates (there is both an HTML and a plain text template) embedded into the binary are identical to the ones in the example configuration file included alongside the binary.

* Use

  If you are happy with the results of your testing then you should be able to create and Action or Effect that is simply the program, like this:

  ```bash
  dv2email
  ```

  While there are some command line flags you should not need to use them in normal operation as all the details are either in the configuration file(s) and the environment variables set by Geneos.

## How It Works

The program has been designed to run under a Geneos Gateway and process the standard environment variables that the Gateway sets when running an Action from a Rule or an Effect from an Alerting hierarchy. The precise list of values differs based on which mechanism is used and also the data item that the Action or Effect is run against. Details are documented here:

* [Actions ðŸ”—](https://docs.itrsgroup.com/docs/geneos/current/Gateway_Reference_Guide/geneos_rulesactionsalerts_tr.html#Action_Configuration)
* [Effects ðŸ”—](https://docs.itrsgroup.com/docs/geneos/current/Gateway_Reference_Guide/geneos_rulesactionsalerts_tr.html#Alerting-Effects)

The primary difference for `dv2email` is that when running from an Alert and Effect some of the email headers are automatically set based on the Notification set-up. `dv2email` will recognise these and process them as expected. For Actions the `To`, `From`, `Subject` items must be set. You can define the defaults in the configuration files and override them using `userdata` functions in the Rule Block, e.g. (in Geneos):

```text
if value > 100 then
    userdata "_TO" "manager@example.com"
    userdata "_SUBJECT" "HELP! It's Broken!"
    run "dv2email Action"
else
...
```

The contents of the email are assembled from the two templates (text and HTML) and any image attachments. The resulting HTML is also run through an "inliner" to ensure that any CSS defined in the HTML `<head>` section is inlined to the tags that need the settings as many email clients (GMail and others) only support a simple HTML5/CSS3 format. If you wnt to save data then you can disable this inlining with the `--inline-css=false` command line flag.

### Running As a Command

To run the `dv2email` program as a right-click style command, allowing users to email dataviews, you have to use command line arguments to extract the XPath components from the command target. These command line arguments are:

```bash
  -E, --entity string     entity name
  -S, --sampler string    sampler name
  -T, --type string       type name
  -D, --dataview string   dataview name

  -t, --to string         To as comma-separated emails
  -c, --cc string         Cc as comma-separated emails
  -b, --bcc string        Bcc as comma-separated emails
```

A typical command (XML below) would be set-up like this. Remember to set the path to the program correctly!

```

## Configuration Reference

### File locations

The `dv2email` program will look in three directories for a `dv2email.yaml` file and merge the contents in the following order (last version of a value "wins"):

1. `/etc/geneos` - a global configuration directory for `geneos`. These are general, global settings and in many instances this directory does not exist.
2. `${HOME}/.config/geneos` - the user's `geneos` configuration directory. This is the user running the program, which again will be typically the Gateway user.
3. Working directory of process - i.e. where you are when you run it, not the installation directory (`pwd`). This is normally the same as the working directory of the Gateway running it.

Additionally there is support for "defaults" files for all the above. You can have `dv2email.defaults.yaml` files in any of the above directories and these are read before the main configurations but after built-in defaults. They make a good option for complex templates that would otherwise pollute the visibility of other configuration options.

Note: If the program is renamed then the base name of all the files above is also changed. e.g. if you rename the program `dv2mailserver` then the configuration files that the program searches for will be `dv2mailserver.yaml` etc.

### Configuration Options

The configuration is in three parts; Gateway connectivity, EMail server connectivity and everything else. These are described below along with the defaults (except the templates which can be quite large):

* `gateway`

  This section is for the connectivity to the Gateway REST API. If `dv2email` is running alongside the Gateway then you probably only need to configure the username and password.

  * `host` - default `localhost`

    The hostname or IP address of the Gateway.

  * `port` - default `7038`

    The port that the Gateway accepts REST Commands on. The default is 7038 regardless of the `use-tls` setting below. This is intentional as the REST Command API will normally only accept commands on a secure port.

  * `use-tls` - default `true`

    Use a secure connection. This is the default for the REST Command API when enabled.

  * `allow-insecure` - default `true`

    This setting controls the checking of the Gateways server certificate and default to `true` as most Gateways will use private certificates.

    In a future release the program may be able to automatically check against the certificate chain created and maintained by the `geneos` program.

  * `username` - no default
  * `password` - no default

    The username and password used to authenticate to the Gateway REST Command API. The password should normally be AES256 encrypted using Geneos formatted secure passwords but enclosed in `cordial` expandable format. These can be generated using `geneos aes password`.

  * `name` - no default

    If no username and password are configured then the program tries to locate credentials using the value of `name` - typically the gateway name - that have been created and stored using `geneos login`. The credential used must be prefixed with `gateway:` to the login command. e.g.

    ```bash
    geneos login gateway:MyGateway -u readonly
    ```

* `email`

  * `smtp` - default `localhost`

    The hostname or IP of the SMTP server.

  * `port` - default `25`

    The port of the SMTP server. While the default is 25 most modern SMTP server will be listening on ports 465 or 587 depending on their configured services, especially when using TLS to protect the connection.

  * `use-tls` - default `default`

    By default the the SMTP connection is made using opportunistic TLS, i.e. TLS is used if the server advertises STARTTLS but otherwise the email is sent in the clear. The other options are `force` and `none` which do what the names suggest.

    Note that is it not possible to ignore server certificate errors for SMTP. This is intentional.

  * `username` - no default
  * `password` - no default

    The username and password to use for the SMTP connection. The password should ne AES256 encrypted as for the Gateway password above.

    If no username or password are given then the SMTP connection is attempted without authentication.

    In a future release there may be support for fetching these values from the `cordial` credentials store but for now they must be in one of the `dv2email` configuration files.

  * `from` - no default
  * `to` - no default
  * `subject` - default `Geneos Alert`

* `column-filter` - default from Environment Variable `__COLUMNS` (two underscores)
* `row-filter` - default from Environment Variable `__ROWS` (two underscores)
* `headline-filter` - default from Environment Variable `__HEADLINES` (two underscores)
* `first-column` - default from Environment Variable `_FIRSTCOLUMN` (single underscore)
* `row-order` - default first column ascending

  These five configuration settings influence the way that Dataview cells are passed into the templates.
  
  The three `filter` items all work the same way but have some difference depending on the dimension of data they apply to. The configuration formats all follow the same pattern:

  ```yaml
  column-filter:
    pattern1: [ item1, item2, item3 ]
    pattern2: [ item4, item5, item6 ]
    '*': [ other, values ]
  ```

  The pattern on the left is matched against the Dataview name and for all the patterns that match the longest match is selected. This means you can have specific configuration for one Dataview and then more general defaults for others. The pattern matching is not a regular expression but the simpler shell style file patterns known as `globbing`. The supported patterns are documented in the Go [path.Match ðŸ”—](https://pkg.go.dev/path#Match) docs. The final pattern above, the catch-all wildcard must be enclosed in quotes for YAML to be valid.

  Once the list of items is matched they are then applied to the data set in the following ways:

  * rows - each item is matched against the rowname using the same `globbing` rules as above. The total set of rows matched is passed to the template in the `Rows` slice. The order of `Rows` is further refined by the `row-order` item (see below).

  * columns - each item is matched against the columns names (except the first column, see below) and the order of the columns is determined by how they matched the items.

    The first column, the `rowname`, is special and is always included. If the program is called from the Gateway on a Dataview table cell then the environment variable `_FIRSTCOLUMN` is set and this is used instead of the literal `rowname`. The configuration item `first-column` can be used, with the same syntax as for the filters above, to define the name on a per-Dataview basis.

  * headlines - Headline cells are treated in a similar way to columns and for all the patterns that match the Dataview name, each item is matched against all the available headlines and all that match are passed into the template. Headlines are not ordered in anyway.

  Rows can be ordered by one column, including the name of the first column (or `rowname` if none is defined) using a similar pattern match to the filters above. Only the first item is used and it must be an exact match for a column name followed by an option '+' or '-' to indicate ascending or descending order, respectively.

* `images`

  A list of image files to embed into the resulting email. The name (on the left) is used as the href `cid` value. e.g.

  ```yaml
  images:
    logo1.png: /path/to/my/logo.png
    alert.png: /path/to/another/image.png
  ```

  In a future release it may be possible to refer to images using URLs or other "expandable" formats but for now they must be file paths and if relative they must be accessibkle from the working directory of the
  process.

* Templates

  The two templates are used to build a multipart alternative MIME message. You should ensure that changes in one template are correctly reflected in the other as both are always used and an unchanged text template, for example, may expose data that is not rendered in an updated HTML template and visa versa.

  The templates are passed the following data structure:

  ```go
  type dv2emailData struct {
    // Dataviews is a slice of each Dataview's data, including Columns and Rows which are ordered names for the columns and rows respectively, suitable for range loops. See https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/itrs-group/cordial/pkg/commands#Dataview for details
    Dataviews []*commands.Dataview

    // Env is a map of environment variable names to values
    Env       map[string]string
  }
  ```

  * `text-template`

    A template in Go [text/template](https://pkg.go.dev/text/template) format to be used to generate the plain text to be used as the `text/plain` alternative part in the email. This part of the email is not normally visible in modern email clients but it is used for assistive text readers and other accessibility tools and should be used to describe the contents of the email.

    The default, embedded text template is:

    ```gotmpl
    This email has been generated by the ITRS Geneos system using the
    dv2email program. If you did not expect to received this email then
    please contact the sender.

    Environment Variables:
    {{range $key, $value := .Env}}
    * {{$key}}={{$value -}}
    {{end}}
    ```

  * `html-template`

    A template in Go [html/template](https://pkg.go.dev/html/template) format to be used to generate the HTML to be used as the `text/html` alternative part of the email.

    The data available to the template (and the text template above) is details in the `dv2email.yaml` file.

    For both template types it is possible to include the contents of a file or a URL using "expandable" syntax, like this:

    ```yaml
    text-template: ${https://myserver.example.com/files/txt.gotmpl}
    html-template: ${file:/path/to/template.gotmpl}
    ```

    The default, embedded HTML template is:

    ```gotmpl
    <html>
    <head>
      <style>
        .CRITICAL {
          background-color: crimson;
