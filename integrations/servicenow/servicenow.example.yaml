# New section "geneos" for inputs from Geneos
geneos:
  # A list of "maps" in YAML speak
  #
  # The "value" is the input from the outside and is subject to "expansion" as per
  # https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/itrs-group/cordial@v1.4.1-beta/pkg/config#ExpandString
  #
  # The basic premise is to import environment variables
  - value: ${_SEVERITY}
    # The "priority" matches Geneos style small to large ordering in
    # which to check the different input values. Any field set in a
    # higher priority (Geneos low-number) group is not overridden later
    # with some exceptions.
    priority: 1
    # A list of value mappings. Each matching value can set (or unset or
    # append to) multiple fields. Special values start with an
    # underscore and are currently:
    #
    #  _default - if this value is not empty and doesn't match any other mapping entry
    #  _empty (or _blank ?) - sets these fields if the value is unset or empty
    mapping:
      _default:
        # in field settings "${value}" is set to the actual value and to
        # incorporate environment variables you MUST use
        # "${env:_VARIABLE}" format. Other embedded items may be set
        # too, e.g. "${name}" for the field name etc. See below for more ideas.
        short_description: ${value} Alert
      _empty:
        # optional. do nothing

# looking at this linearly, as a top-down config, at this point we have
# a "bag" of fields set to specific values. any fields that are prefixed
# with underscores will be used but then not sent to ServiceNow. All
# other fields, after processing below, will be sent to ServiceNow.
