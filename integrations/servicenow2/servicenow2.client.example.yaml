#

# The `proxy` section contains the details on where to reach the proxy

proxy:
  # `url` is the proxy endpoint not including table name and is used
  # for GET, POST and PUT requests
  url: http://localhost:3000/snow/api/v2

  # for the `client` command. This setting can be overridden on the
  # command line using the `--query/-q` flag.
  default-query: "active=true^opened_byLIKEgeneos"

  # `authentication` contains the chosen authentication between the
  # client/query commands and the proxy. At the moment only `token` is
  # supported.
  authentication:
    # the `token` can be any string as long as it is the same on both
    # proxy and client/query side. To protect the plain text, if
    # required, you can use `geneos aes password` to create an encoded

    # to the user. This also allows the configuration file to be shared
    # without sharing the plaintext of the key.

# default ServiceNow fields
#
# The `defaults` section and each of the named entries in the `profiles`
# section share the same format.
#
# The layout is a sequence of mappings The format is an array of objects
# which are evaluated in array order, but the keys in each object are
# evaluated according to the rules below
#
# the mapping keys are below, and processed in the order shown:
#
#   - `if` - this can be either a single string or an array; the values
#     are evaluated and the result of each parsed as a boolean. As soon
#     as any `if` value returns a false value, evaluation stops and
#     evaluation continues with the next array element. If there is no
#     `if` then this is the same as a `true` values being returned.
#   - `set` - is a list of name/value pairs (a YAML dictionary) and the
#     client sets all the fields names (in an undefined order) to the
#     expanded values on the right
#   - `unset` - is list of names. unset any fields given.
#   - `subgroup` - evaluate a subsection, and terminating evaluation if the
#     subsection uses `break`
#   - `break` - break stops processing of the level above the block it
#     appears in, and is used to terminate further evaluation of `if`s
#     etc.
#
# all field names beginning with an underscore (`_`) are treated as
# internal values between client and proxy and are renamed or removed
# before being sent to the ServiceNow instance by the proxy.
#
# all field values are subject to expansion according to the `cordial`
# config package `ExpandString` function with some custom functions: 
defaults:
  - set:
      # standard mappings for all Geneos Actions and Effects
      #
      # as these are all prefixed with an underscore, they are visible
      # to the proxy but are removed before the incident is created or
