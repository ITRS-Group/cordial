# Servicenow Geneos Integration v2 - proxy configuration
#
# The proxy acts as a single point of contact to the Servicenow
# instance. The proxy supports two endpoints, one to GET existing
# incidents for display as a Dataview and the other for the submission
# of incidents, either new or updates.
#

server:
  # answer requests on a concatenation of `proxy.listen`, `proxy.path`
  # and table name, where the table is looked up against the "tables"
  # section below
  listen: localhost:3000
  path: /snow/api/v2
  tls:
    enabled: false
    skip-verify: false
    # PEM formatted certificate, either a multiline string or an
    # expandable format reference to an external file
    certificate: ${file:/path/to/cert.pem}
    # or
    # certificate: |
    #   -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
    #   ...


    # PEM formatted unencrypted private key, either a multiline string
    # or an expandable format reference to an external file
    private-key: ${file:/path/to/cert.key}

  # add support later for basic, oauth, cert etc. token only for now
  authentication:
    # the `token` can be any string as long as it is the same on both
    # proxy and client - the client being either the incident poster or a
    # GET requests for all incidents. To protect the plain text, if
    # required, you can use `geneos aes password` to create an encoded
    # strings that replies on the security of the key file being read-only
    # to the user. This also allows the configuration file to be shared
    # without sharing the plaintext of the key.

  tables:
    # multiple tables are supported through the client side `--table`
    # option which results in a different endpoint used for each table.
    # The named tables below are selected by the last part of the
    # endpoint URL, e.g. `/snow/api/v2/incident`
    #
    # if a table configuration does not exist an error is returned
    - name: incident
      # the query endpoint is configured below:
      query:
        enabled: true
        
        search: "user=${servicenow.username}"
        # fields are returned in the order below. to ensure that Geneos
        # row-names are unique make sure that the first column is a
        # primary key, as below
        fields: [ number, sys_id, cmdb_ci.name, short_description, description, correlation_id, opened_by, state ]

      # the rest of the configuration is concerned with creating and updating incidents

      # `search` is the ServiceNow filter query used to lookup existing
      # incidents
      #

      # In addition to referring to other configuration values in the
      # proxy configuration file as `${config:servicenow.parameter}`,
      # other dynamically set parameters available are:
      #
      #   * ${cmdb_ci}
      #   * ${correlation_id}
      #
      # For example, to exclude "Resolved" incidents from being found
      # and updated, instead requiring a new incident to be created, use
      # this:
      #
      #     search: "state!=6^active=true^cmdb_ci=${cmdb_ci}^correlation_id=${correlation_id}^ORDERBYDESCnumber"
      #
      # The default search, if not otherwise defined, is:
      search: "active=true^cmdb_ci=${cmdb_ci}^correlation_id=${correlation_id}^ORDERBYDESCnumber"
