# `gdna` Dashboards

The files in this directory are the three standard dashboards to present your collected coverage data.

You should first import them into your Active Console to check everything is working and once you are satisfied all is in order you can then import them into a Web Dashboard Server for wider display.

They require the data points displayed to be in specific places in your Gateway and also a special Gateway Attribute `DASHBOARD` to be set to `PROD` (by default). To use multiple copies of these dashboards on a single server you can refactor this Attribute value.

See the main [README.md](../README.md) for more details.
